# NetflixExtension

Simple Firefox extension for netflix that displays the IMDb rating when you hover over a title.

# How it works

Send a get request to the https://www.omdbapi.com/ api with the title you are hovering over and gets the IMDb rating and displays it. Pretty simple. 

# How to get it working

Currently, since I am using an 3rd party API it does not work out of the box. 

go to https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx

Create an account to get an API Key, it will be sent to your email. 

After install the extension you can:

1. Click on the extension 
2. Paste in the API Key and click save.

OR

1. Goto about:addons
2. Goto Extensions
3. Click Netflix-IMDb
4. Click Preferences
5. Paste API key here, click save.
